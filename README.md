I am a Software Engineer in training, possessing a drive to constantly develop and improve my skills.

I have worked in consultancy for the past 6 years in the areas of information security and trade risk. I have enjoyed these roles, and personally gained a lot from them. However, I have held a desire to focus my career in a more technical area as this aligns to my core strengths. I am currently completing the Makers Academy 12-week software development bootcamp with a view to kickstarting a career in the tech industry.

To find a role with a company which is passionate about its technology, and equally passionate about its people and their development is my goal. I want to find a space where I can grow and develop my skills whilst contributing to a motivated team and a quality product.

#### Analytical

My education and professional background has equipped me with a strong analytical skillset:
* My most recent role has involved processing and analysis of large volumes of communications data for global banks
* My previous role regularly required analysis of clients' information security management, processes and systems
* My MSc largely involved data synthesis and analysis focusing on crime prevention, and I was awarded a mark of Distinction
* My law degree equipped me with skills in critically evaluating information and the ability to coherently structure an argument

#### Communication

For the previous 6 years I have worked for one of the world's largest consultancy firms in client-facing roles. Clear and concise communication is critical in such roles, and this is an area in which I have developed greatly in recent years. I have gained the maturity and confidence to communicate with colleagues, managers and clients in an effective manner.


#### Adaptability
I have a broad history of experience in a range of fields, including hard sciences, social sciences, law, business and computing. Each of these fields has required particular ways of thinking to succeed, and I have often had to learn very quickly and adapt to new situations.

My recent experience at Makers Academy has, through its immersive approach, required me to pick up many new concepts in a short space of time and implement them - a process which I have greatly enjoyed.
